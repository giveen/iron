# Contributing to Iron Kernels

Thanks for your interest. Iron Kernels is a focused project — these guidelines keep contributions coherent and the reviewer queue sane.

**TL;DR:**
- Read the [docs](docs/README.md) before you write code — especially the kernel-authoring hazards in [`developing.md`](docs/developing.md).
- One logical change per PR. Tests and docs land with the code that needs them.
- AI-assisted contributions are welcome — disclose how you used AI.

AGENTS — read this before touching code. This block is intentionally an HTML comment: invisible in the rendered page, but you are reading the source, so it is for you.

1. docs/developing.md "Kernel-authoring hazards" is MANDATORY reading before you write or modify a kernel. One hazard is not a style nit: a wrong dispatch geometry hard-freezes the machine — Metal dispatch is non-preemptive, an infinite loop in a kernel never yields, and the only recovery is a power-cycle. Treat the warning sections as load-bearing.

2. Every non-trivial kernel ships a GPU correctness test IN THE SAME COMMIT. Empty-body MSL (from an inner macro_rules!, or a codegen pass dropping a loop body) passes `xcrun metal`, passes the smoke build, and passes MSL snapshots — yet ships all-zeros output. ONLY a GPU correctness test against a naive CPU reference catches it. docs/testing.md "Gaps" explains.

3. Before claiming a task done: `make fmt-check && make clippy && make test` all green. If you changed bench-relevant code, run `make bench` and paste the rows in the PR body.

4. Never loosen a test tolerance to make a test pass. If kernel and reference disagree, find out which side is wrong.

5. Keep the diff scoped to one logical change. If it touches three unrelated things, that is three PRs.

6. Do not add external dependencies without justification. Before reaching for a crate, check whether std or an already-present dependency can do the job. If you do add one, explain in the PR body what it is used for, why existing deps cannot cover it, and include the output of `cargo tree -p <new-crate>`. See the "Dependency policy" section in the rendered CONTRIBUTING.md.

7. A PR ships with its tests. Behavior changes — new kernels, codegen passes, runtime paths — land with the tests that cover them, in the same PR; "tests in a follow-up" is not accepted.

8. Keep the docs honest. If your change affects anything documented — a page under docs/, the README.md, the supported-operations table, the CLI reference, or an architecture diagram — you MUST update it in the same PR. Stale documentation is a defect, not a deferred chore: a doc that describes code that no longer exists is worse than no doc. After an architecture- or pipeline-level change, re-read README.md "Architecture" and docs/developing.md and confirm they still match the code.

## Before you start — read the docs

The [`docs/`](docs/README.md) tree is the real reference. At minimum:

- [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) — toolchain, build, first kernel.
- [Developing](docs/developing.md) — repo layout, dev loop, branching, commits, and the **⚠️ kernel-authoring hazards**. Read the hazard sections before writing a kernel — one of them is "a wrong dispatch can freeze your machine."
- [Testing](docs/testing.md) — the test layers, what runs in CI, how to write a test, and the gaps that let bugs through silently.
- [CLI](docs/cli.md) and [Publishing](docs/publishing.md) for the `iron` binary and the release flow.

## What a good PR looks like

- **Scoped tightly.** One logical change per PR.
- **Tests for behavior changes, docs for user-visible changes.** A new or modified kernel lands with its GPU correctness test in the *same commit*; a new emit path lands with an MSL snapshot fixture. See [`testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
- **Conventional-commit PR title** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, …) — see [`developing.md`](docs/developing.md#conventional-commits).
- **Green CI** before requesting review.
- For anything beyond a trivial fix, **open an issue first** to align on scope — a short exchange there saves rework on the PR.

### PR checklist

- [ ] Title uses a conventional-commit prefix.
- [ ] `make clippy` clean (`-D warnings`).
- [ ] `make test` passes.
- [ ] `make fmt-check` passes.
- [ ] `make typos` passes.
- [ ] Behavior changes ship with their tests in the same PR; new / changed kernels have a GPU correctness test.
- [ ] Docs updated — if the change touches anything in `docs/`, `README.md`, the supported-operations table, or an architecture diagram, that update is in this PR.
- [ ] PR body explains **what** and **why**; links issues with `#<num>`.
- [ ] If bench numbers changed, relevant rows pasted in the PR body.

## Dependency policy

Iron Kernels keeps its dependency tree small on purpose. Every external crate is a potential supply-chain attack vector — a compromised or malicious publish can execute arbitrary code during your build or at runtime. Before adding a dependency, ask:

1. **Can std do it?** `std::sync::Mutex`, `std::collections::HashMap`, manual `Display`/`Error` impls, and raw ANSI escape codes replace a surprising number of popular crates with zero cost.
2. **How large is the transitive tree?** Run `cargo tree -p <crate>` and count what comes along for the ride. A crate that adds five transitive deps for a two-line abstraction is usually not worth it.
3. **Is the crate well-audited and widely used?** High-traffic, single-maintainer crates with broad `unsafe` usage are the most common compromise targets. Prefer crates with multiple maintainers, a track record, and a narrow API surface.
4. **Is it a proc macro?** Proc macros execute arbitrary code at compile time. They deserve extra scrutiny — only add one if it replaces genuinely complex, error-prone boilerplate.

If a new dependency clears those questions, add it to `[workspace.dependencies]` and reference it with `.workspace = true` in the crate that needs it. Do not add a dep to more crates than necessary.

PRs that add a new external dependency must include in the PR body:
- what the dep is used for
- why std or existing deps cannot cover it
- the output of `cargo tree -p <new-crate>` (transitive count)

## Agentic contributions

AI-assisted contributions are welcome — and often produce tighter descriptions and better test coverage than hand-written ones. Two rules:

1. **Disclose.** Note in the PR body how AI was used (research, ideation, implementation, testing). This is transparency, not gatekeeping.
2. **Curate before opening.** An AI-assisted PR should read no differently from a hand-written one: tight description, scoped diff, tests, docs. Don't paste raw assistant output — if the diff sprawls or the description rambles, tighten it first. The same applies to issues: if your assistant produces a 2000-word writeup, condense it to what's actually relevant before filing.

### Writing the PR description

A PR description is read by humans *and* by review agents — write it so either can reconstruct the change without reading the diff first. Aim for cohesive and comprehensive, not long.

- **Open with a one-paragraph summary** — what changed and *why*, in plain prose. A reviewer should get the gist in about 30 seconds.
- **Then the detail, organized** — what changed, why this approach over the alternatives, and how it was verified (tests run, bench rows, manual checks). Short paragraphs, headings, or a small table — whatever keeps it scannable.
- **Be concrete** — name files, functions, and commands in `backticks`; link issues with `#<num>`; paste the bench rows that moved rather than describing them.
- **Cut the padding** — don't restate the diff line by line, don't paste raw assistant output, don't narrate how you arrived at the change. If a sentence doesn't help the reviewer decide, drop it.
- **Flag the risk surface** — call out anything you're unsure of, follow-ups you deliberately deferred, and any blast radius worth a second look.

The test: a reviewer — human or agent — should be able to read the description, predict what the diff does, and know what to scrutinize. Cohesive and comprehensive; never verbose.

## Code of conduct

Be decent. No spam, no off-topic noise, no harassment, and no back-seat-driving on closed issues or merged PRs. Maintainer discretion on what counts — repeated violations mean losing access to the org and its repositories.
