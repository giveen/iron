//! Kernel standard library, grouped by **operation family** — the consolidation
//! target (see `docs/specs/KERNEL_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`). Families migrate here
//! one PR at a time from the legacy `mlx/` + `ffai/` folders. Kernels are named
//! for the **operation / layout** they implement (`mt_<op>`), never for a model;
//! model-specific usage notes live in comments above the kernel. The FFAI emit
//! consumer is regenerated from the new inventory after each family lands.
