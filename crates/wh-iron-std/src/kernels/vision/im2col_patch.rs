//! Patch im2col — unfold an NCHW image into one row per (non-overlapping)
//! `patch × patch` block, flattened `(c, py, px)`, ready for the patch-embed
//! GEMM.
//!
//! The gather every patch-embed vision tower does before its embed matmul:
//! `out[patch, (c·p + py)·p + px] = input[c, pr·p + py, pc·p + px]` where the
//! patch grid is `grid_h × grid_w = (H/p) × (W/p)` and `patch = pr·grid_w +
//! pc`. Replaces the scalar CPU unfold loops (Gemma 4 `unfoldPatches`, and
//! any patch-embed tower) with a single GPU gather, so the resulting
//! `[n_patches, channels·p·p]` rows feed straight into `Ops.gemm`.
//!
//! Non-overlapping (stride == patch, no padding) — the patch-embed case. For
//! the temporal / K-tile-padded row widths some towers want, the caller
//! sizes `patch_dim` accordingly and zero-fills the pad columns separately.
//!
//! Layouts:
//!   input  `[channels, in_h, in_w]`                     T   (NCHW, batch 1)
//!   out    `[n_patches, channels·patch·patch]`          T
//!   n_patches = grid_h · grid_w,  in_h = grid_h·patch,  in_w = grid_w·patch
//!
//! ## DISPATCH INVARIANTS
//!
//! Grid3D, one thread per output element — dispatch with
//! `grid_1d(n_patches · channels · patch · patch, 256)`.
