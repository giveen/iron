# Individual Contributors

If you wish to be acknowledged for your contributions, please list your name
with a short description of your contribution(s) below. For example:

- Jane Smith: Added the `foo` and `bar` ops.

MetalTile was developed with contributions from the following individuals:

- clandestine.eth (@0xClandestine) — Founded the project and designed the full stack: #[kernel] proc-macro DSL, body parser, IR, MSL codegen + optimization passes, graph-driven fusion, and cross-kernel calling.
- Tom Turney (@TheTom): Contributed many kernels, including Flash-Attention-2 SDPA, simdgroup-matrix quantised GEMM/GEMV, MoE + gated-delta-network kernels, sampling + logits processors, fused activations, ICB `_record` codegen, and kernel-pack infrastructure. He spearheaded adding GPU correctness tests and generally boosting overall test and CI infrastructure for improved regression testing.
- Eric Kryski (@ekryski): Contributed most of the kernels, including int4, int8, bf16 and fp16 completeness, AURA, image and audio kernels. Additionally, added the initial documentation and performed and catalogued the kernel audit against upstream sources with verification against real model workloads.
- Ambisphaeric (@Ambisphaeric): CI hygiene, bench dirty-tree guard, GPU correctness tests, a few kernel tuning wins, project bot, and PM duties.
